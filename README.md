# Helplessly-Wandering

During my senior year of high school I decided to take AP Computer Science. While I learned a lot from the class, I learned the most from the final project. For the project our teacher told us to impress him. While many of the student coded things like tic-tac-toe and other simple games I decided to see how far I could go with my new coding skills

It turned out I could not do much, but with the help of Google and several tutorial videos I was able to get even together to get an A on the final. Modeled after one of my friends favorite game, Zork, my game is a very simple text based game in which the player is trying to piece together limited information to escape from a deserted island.

After finishing high school Helplessly Wandering fell to the waste side. This mostly was because I learned easier ways to code games such as Unity. Recently though I decided to go through and update the game. Most notably I went through and reduced the amount of if statements there was in the code. I did this by creating more object classes and several managing classes. By doing this I made the game run fast and made the code easier to read. Finally I did add some new content and fixed a lot of bugs. While I might of had a working game back in high school the game is now on a completely different level.

If you are looking to play this game you can. All you have to do is download the HelplesslyWandering.jar file. You can then simply run this file and start playing.

If you are looking to look through my code you can download the whole repository. If you are looking to run the code without using the HelplesslyWandering.jar file make sure that the res file is in the build path.
